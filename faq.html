              <h3>Do you charge any fees?</h3>
              <p>
                No. There are no fees.

                The calculated amount you see on the homepage is the only amount you will pay. KryptoPayments makes money from currency spread.

              <h3>What exchange rate do you use?  </h3>
              <p>
                We dynamically calculate the current exchange rate based on multiple exchanges with adequate liquidity available to Australia. Rates are updated every 1 minute.

              <h3>Are there any payment limits?</h3>
              <p>
                Individual transactions are limited to a maximum of $1000 each due to ASIC regulatory requirements.
              </p>
              <br/>
              <p>
                However, if you wish to pay a bill that totals more than $1000, that's perfectly ok. You can simply create two or more bills with the same payment details (use the "copy details to new bill" button to make this easier). This will work for all BPAY and Bank Account payments.
              </p>
              <p>Full details are in our disclosure document.</p>

              <h3>What kind of bills can I pay?</h3>
              <p>You can pay any bill that has the BPAY logo and Biller Code. More than 19,000 businesses accept payments using BPAY. You can also pay to any Australian bank account, even your own! </p>
              <br/>
              <p>KryptoPayments is not affiliated with or endorsed by BPAY.</p>

              <h3>How do I sign up?</h3>
              <p>You don't need to create an account to use our site, you can pay any bill without logging in. </p>
              <br/>
              <p>But if you choose to sign in it will remember your bill payment history and reward points for you. Just click "Sign in" on the rewards page. </p>
              <br/>
              <p>We use a "password-less" login system. There are no passwords - all you need to do to login is enter the two temporary login words that get emailed to you. These login words will change each time you login, they are one time use only. The website will remember you forever, so you won't have to do this login process very often. </p>
              <br/>
              <p>We also care deeply about our customers' privacy. We store an absolute minimum of customer data - we don't ask for your name, date of birth, or anything else about you apart from an email address that you can use to login with.</p>
            </div><div class="privacy_points">
              <h3>When does my bill get paid?</h3>
              <p>You'll see a confirmation usually within a few seconds of making your bitcoin payment. We process the payment after 4 confirmations on the same day that the bitcoin transaction is done (though cut-off times must be taken into account - see the next question). We carry the burden of risk on any rate movements.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="privacy_points">
              <h3>How long before the biller gets my payment?</h3>
              <p>If we receive your payment before 5pm on a Bank Business Day, the biller will acknowledge the payment as having been made on that day and should process the payment on the next banking business day. If we receive a payment on a weekend or public holiday or after 5pm, the biller will receive the payment within 2 banking business days.</p>

              <h3>Can I pay my credit card with bitcoin?</h3>
              <p>Yes. Most, if not all of the major banks in Australia allow you to make credit card payments as BPAY bills.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>All you will need is the corresponding Biller code and Ref # (in most cases it is your credit card number) which you can request from your credit card provider.</p>
              <br/>
              <p>When a credit card number is used as a biller reference, it is transmitted securely and confidentially.</p>
